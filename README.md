## Android_IDTech_VP3300_Demo

This demo is a modified version of IDTech's VP3300 Android demo. It demonstrates Clearent's android solution for IDTech's VP33000 credit card reader. See the <a href="https://github.com/clearent/android-idtech-sdk" target="_blank">android-idtech-sdk</a> for integration instructions.

When the card data is converted to a transaction token, the demo will also show how a payment transaction can be performed. It will also show how you can send a receipt to the customer.
